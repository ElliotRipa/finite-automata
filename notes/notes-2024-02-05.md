When writing out the path for an NFA and reaching multiple states, if you then take an path that goes nowhere, that state can be denoted using phi.

If you can run a machine that ends in any set of states, at least one of which is accepting, then the NFA accepts.

## NFA-DFA conversion

Every DFA is an NFA, but not vice versa. However, there is an equivalent DFA for every NFA.

Because DFA has the transition function δ=QxΣ -> Q, where NFA have δ=QxΣ -> 2^Q
And because 2^Q contains Q. Yes.

When making a DFA table from an NFA, every transition that would lead to multiple states can be combined to a new
state. i.e {A,B} can be translated to {AB} whose transitions are the union of the transitions of A and B.
In this case, if either A or B was a final state, then for the DFA, they must both be.
